        <p>My school life has been an amazing journey so far. I started my education in a small primary school and
          then
          moved on to a bigger secondary school. <br> Throughout my school life, I have been fortunate enough to have
          experienced a positive and supportive learning environment. <br> I have made many great friends, learned
          valuable
          lessons and developed my passion for learning.

          My school life has not just been about <br> studying and getting good grades, it has also been about
          extracurricular
          activities and sports. I have been a member of the school's debate club, music club and basketball team. <br>
          Participating in these activities has not only helped me to build my skills and confidence, but it has
          also allowed me to meet new people and form new relationships.</p>

        <p>Debate is a process that involves formal discourse, discussion, and oral addresses on a particular topic or
          collection of topics, often with a moderator and an audience. In a debate, arguments are put forward for
          common opposing viewpoints. Debates have historically occurred in public meetings, academic institutions,
          debate halls, coffeehouses, competitions, and legislative assemblies.Debates have also been conducted for
          educational and recreational purposes.The term "debate" may also be applied to a more continuous, inclusive
          and less formalized process through which issues are explored and resolved across a range of agencies and
          among the general public: for example the European Commission in 2021 published a Green Paper on Ageing
          intended to generate such a debate on "policies to address the challenges and opportunities of ageing" in
          forthcoming years, and Pope Francis refers to "the need for forthright and honest debate" on society and
          the environment in his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato si'.</p>

        <p>Sports develop the physical as well as mental strength in students. Daily physical exercise is essential for
          students because exercise not only helps students to stay healthy, but it also helps to improve their
          emotional fitness.

          Sports should be a major part of the school curriculum because if students stay emotionally and physically
          healthy, they can easily focus on their studies. Students have to participate in school sports to increase
          confidence, mental alertness, and self-esteem.

          Sports are important in schools because it helps to teach various skills to students like leadership,
          patience, patience, team efforts, and social skills. Here we are discussing some benefits of the importance of
          sports in Schools.</p>

        <p>Science exhibitions are events or displays organized by schools, science centers, institutions, government
          agencies, or private organizations. The main purpose of these exhibitions is to educate and engage students
          and individuals by showcasing and explaining concepts, discoveries, innovations, and experiments. They aim to
          enhance people’s understanding of the world and the scientific method while sparking curiosity and promoting
